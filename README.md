## <a name="project-description"><a/>Team name: Cool name pending (Big Data (DS-GA 1004) / 18' Spring)
 In terms of big data, we often face a lot of data issues. So we target the main data quality issues in the 7 datasets we process. And then we demonstrate the rules to do the data cleaning and aggregation which can be a guide for people who deal with big urban data. In this project, we calculate mutual information inside a dataset and cross different datasets. The correlation analysis based on the data processing and facts really help to make insights on the city functions and make better decisions on urban planning.
 
  In this project, we introduce the pipeline of correlation analysis based on the spatiotemporal dataset. Our project follows the steps of data cleaning, Data integration, correlation calculation, visualization and analysis.
